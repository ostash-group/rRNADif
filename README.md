# Introduction
rRNADif is a method to measure intragenomic 16S rRNA variability within the desired genome sequence against a chosen set of organisms. The app is calculating ML phylogenetic tree and uses mean/median branch length within set of 16S rRNA as a measure of variability between them <br>
By default precomputed database of 21000+ fully sequenced bacterial genomes is available for comparison. However, custom database generation is possible (see [documentation](https://pavlohrab.github.io/rRNADif-docs/))<br>
